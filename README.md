## Custom Logger

Our Astro SSR SPA template includes a custom logger designed to handle traffic, error, and Content Security Policy (CSP) reports. This logger provides detailed and colorful output in both file logs and the server console, making it easier to track and debug issues. It uses the `preryConsole` library to add color and highlight different sections of the logs, enhancing readability and making it fully customizable.

### Features

-  **Traffic Logging:** Records incoming traffic details, including request paths, methods, and response statuses.
-  **Error Logging:** Captures error messages, stack traces, and context for troubleshooting.
-  **CSP Reports:** Logs Content Security Policy violations to help monitor and enforce security policies.
-  **Color Highlighting:** Utilizes `preryConsole` to apply color and formatting to various log sections, improving visual distinction.
-  **Customizable:** Allows customization of log colors and the information included in each log entry.

### Customization

You can customize the logger by modifying its configuration file or directly in the code. Here’s how:

-  **Colors:** Adjust the color scheme used for different log sections (e.g., traffic, errors, CSP reports) by changing the color codes in the logger configuration.
-  **Log Information:** Customize the information included in the logs by updating the logger's format settings. You can choose what details to log and their arrangement.

### Usage

To use the custom logger, simply integrate it into your application’s request handling and error management processes. Here's a basic example of how to set it up:
(This area need updated)

```javascript
const customLogger = require('./path/to/customLogger')

// Initialize the logger with custom settings
customLogger.initialize({
   colorScheme: {
      traffic: 'green',
      errors: 'red',
      csp: 'yellow'
   },
   logToFile: true,
   logToConsole: true
})

// Log a traffic entry
customLogger.logTraffic(req)

// Log an error
customLogger.logError(err)

// Log a CSP report
customLogger.logCSP(cspReport)
```

For more detailed customization options and usage instructions, refer to the [Custom Logger Documentation](./path/to/loggerDocumentation).

### Examples

-  **Traffic Log:**

   ```
   [2024-08-26 10:00:00] [INFO] [green] GET /api/data - 200 OK
   ```

-  **Error Log:**

   ```
   [2024-08-26 10:05:00] [ERROR] [red] TypeError: Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined
       at /path/to/file.js:10:20
   ```

-  **CSP Report:**
   ```
   [2024-08-26 10:10:00] [CSP] [yellow] Blocked script-src violation on https://example.com
   ```

## Concurrently and Wait-On with Microsoft DevTunnel

**`concurrently`** and **`wait-on`** are powerful tools used together to manage and synchronize multiple processes in your development workflow.

-  **`concurrently`**: This tool allows you to run multiple commands simultaneously in a single terminal. In your setup, it is used to run both the server and the DevTunnel setup concurrently, ensuring that both processes are started and managed together.

-  **`wait-on`**: This tool is used to wait for specific resources or conditions before proceeding with other tasks. In your setup, `wait-on` monitors a configuration file (`waiton.json`) to ensure that the server is up and running before starting the DevTunnel. This ensures that the tunnel is only established when the server is ready, avoiding potential connection issues.

**Run it**:

-  With Bun:
   ```bash
   bun serve:tunnel
   ```
-  With npm:
   ```bash
   npm serve:tunnel
   ```

Here’s how it works in your workflow:

1. **Start the Server and DevTunnel**:

   -  **`concurrently`** runs both the server and the DevTunnel commands at the same time.

   -  **`wait-on`** is used to monitor the server's readiness, based on the configuration in `waiton.json`.

2. **Server Initialization**:

   -  **`wait-on`** checks if the server is up by looking for a specific condition defined in `waiton.json`.

3. **DevTunnel Setup**:
   -  Once the server is confirmed to be running, **`concurrently`** continues with the DevTunnel setup, exposing your local server to the internet through a secure, temporary URL.

This setup ensures a smooth development experience by coordinating server startup and tunnel creation, making it easier to test and share your local application.

## Microsoft DevTunnel

Microsoft DevTunnel provides a secure, customizable tunnel to your local development environment. It’s particularly useful for exposing your local server to the internet, which is essential for tasks like remote testing and integration.

For a detailed guide on installing and using Microsoft DevTunnel, you can refer to the official [Microsoft DevTunnel documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/).

Note: The dev tunnel listens for the server to start by way of a waiton.json configuration and then runs concurrently afterwards.

1. **Install DevTunnel**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g devtunnel
   ```

2. **Start DevTunnel**: Expose a local port (e.g., port 3000):

   ```bash
   devtunnel host 3000
   ```

3. **Access the Tunnel**: DevTunnel will generate a URL to access your local server from anywhere.

For detailed instructions and additional usage options, visit the [Microsoft DevTunnel documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/).

**Astro Project Structure**

This section provides an overview of the project's directory structure and key components, organized to help you quickly build and scale your e-commerce site. Understanding this structure will enable you to navigate and utilize the [Astro SSR SPA](https://github.com/dansasser/astro-ssr-spa) template effectively. Here’s a breakdown of the key directories and their roles:

#### Root Directory

-  **`src/`**: The primary directory for your [Astro project code](https://astro.build/), including pages, components, and styles. Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files here to determine routes and page content.

   -  **`src/components/`**: Contains reusable UI components compatible with **Astro** and other frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, or Preact.
   -  **`src/layouts/`**: Defines the layout structure for your pages, including headers, footers, and other consistent elements.
   -  **`src/pages/`**: Houses your site’s pages. **Astro** generates routes based on the filenames of `.astro` or `.md` files in this directory.
   -  **`index.astro`**
   -  **Description:** The `index.astro` file is the main container for the single-page application (SPA). It sets up the primary layout and manages routing within the application.
   -  **Usage:** This file initializes the SPA structure and dynamically renders content based on user interactions.

   ```astro
   <!-- Example content for index.astro -->
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>Astro SSR SPA</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <!-- Main layout and dynamic content will be loaded here -->
       <div id="app">
         <!-- HTMX will load content into this container -->
       </div>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

-  **`content/`**

   -  **Description:** The `content` directory stores all the pages for the application. HTMX is used to dynamically load these pages into the SPA.
   -  **Usage:** Place your individual page files in this directory. HTMX will handle the dynamic loading of these pages based on user interactions.

   ```html
   <!-- Example page in content directory -->
   <!-- content/home.astro -->
   <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Home Page</h1>
      <p>This is the main content of the home page.</p>
   </div>
   ```

#### Additional Directories

-  **`lib/`**

   -  **Description:** Contains essential [server functions](https://github.com/dansasser/astro-ssr-spa) used by the `server.mjs` entry point, enabling server-side functionality and integration.
   -  **Usage:** Place server-side functions and utilities here that are used across different parts of the application.

-  **`types/` and `interfaces/`**

   -  **Description:** These directories are used to store [TypeScript types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) and interfaces.
   -  **Usage:** Keep TypeScript definitions outside the `src` directory for enhanced security and better code organization.

-  **`public/`**

   -  **Description:** The `public` directory holds static assets that do not need processing or compilation. Files placed here, such as images, fonts, and other media, are served directly to the browser.
   -  **Usage:** Use this directory for any static files that should be accessible via URL, like logos, background images, and downloadable files. These assets are referenced in your project using relative paths.

-  **`styles/`**
   -  **Description:** The `styles` directory contains global CSS files and configuration for utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS.
   -  **Usage:** Store your global styles, CSS variables, and Tailwind configurations in this directory to ensure a consistent design language across the entire site. This directory is crucial for maintaining a cohesive look and feel throughout your application.

#### Configuration Files

-  **`package.json`**

   -  **Description:** Contains metadata about the project and dependencies.
   -  **Usage:** Manage project dependencies and scripts from this file.

-  **`astro.config.mjs`**
   -  **Description:** Configuration file for Astro settings.
   -  **Usage:** Customize Astro's build and development settings.
